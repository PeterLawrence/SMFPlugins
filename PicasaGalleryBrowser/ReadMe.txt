Picasa Gallery Browser Mod Version 0.6
*******************************

This mod allows you to browse public albums of a Picasa Gallery as part of your SMF forum.

Once installed this mod places a Picasa Gallery menu item to the default forum.
Before you can view your selected Picasa Album you need to go the Picasa Galley Browser admin settings which can be found…
In SMF  1.1 admin options are found in the Features and Settings admin page under "Layout and Options".
In SMF 2.0 admin options are found under Miscellaneous in Configuration, Modifications of your admin panel.

Set the server to your Picasa server i.e. http://picasaweb.google.com and user name to your Picasaweb username. Make sure that there is no spaces after the username or server address when entering them into the relevant text boxes.

Admin options include... 
1) The Ability to restrict this gallery browser to display just one selected album.
2) An optional default Album. Leave blank if you wish, by default, to list the public albums. 
3) Set the number of images to display per a row.
