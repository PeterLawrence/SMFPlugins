Flickr Gallery Browser Mod Version 0.7
*******************************

This mod allows you to browse public sets/groups of a Flickr Gallery as part of your SMF forum.

Note before using this mod you'll need to obtain a Flickr API key from http://www.flickr.com/services/api/key.gne.

When installed this mod places a Flickr Gallery menu item on the default forum forum theme.
Before you can view your selected Flickr Sets/groups you need to go the Flickr Galley Browser admin settings which can be found…
In SMF  1.1 admin options are found in the Features and Settings admin page under "Layout and Options".
In SMF 2.0 admin options are found under Miscellaneous in Configuration, Modifications of your admin panel.

Once in the admin settings enter your Flickr API Key and user name in the relevant text boxes. Make sure that there is no spaces after the username or API Key when entering them into the relevant text boxes.

Other admin options include... 
1) An optional default "Set/Group". Leave blank if you wish, by default, to list the public set/groups. 
2) The ability to restrict this gallery browser to display just the default "set/group".
3) Control over the number of images to display per a row.
4) The option to enable either database or file caching.
